        What is HTML?
    </h2>
    <h4>
        Hypertext markup language. It is the language that web browsers read to build a web page. 
It acts as a ‘blueprint’ to display data on a user’s screen. This is the basic building block of 
the web. Every page on the Internet is just HTML at its core.
